## To-Do List
Just a normal to-do list that has an option to change status of an item from "incomplete" to "complete" and vice versa. Delete button for each list item is present. No backend so list empties after page reload.

### Future Updates
1. Better appearance
2. Delete multiple items at once
3. Change priority (order of items)
4. Add deadlines for each item
5. Allow user to classify items as per choice
